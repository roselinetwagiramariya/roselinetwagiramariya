- 👋 Hi, I’m @roselinetwagiramariya a.k.a. Roseline but I prefer to be called Rose.
  
- 👀 I’m interested in ...a LOT of things. That is a really vague prompt but to elaborate I call myself a data/analytics nerd because I love data storytelling. I am a naturally curious
person so I just like knowing things for the sake of knowing them.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... The Murderbot Diaries by Martha Wells, I'm on the last book in a series of 5 called the Network Effect and it's about a jailbroken security robot that is so relatable.
I am also reading Octabia Butler has ever written. I have read almost everything by her expect Kindred which may surprise some because Kindred is often the novel that others start by.
  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... a wide variety of data analysis and collection projects. So that means that:  
  1. I can handle end-to-end data projects from cleaning to visualizing to reporting (data entry too!).
  2. I have strong writing skills so I can write technical reports that follow any outline given to me.
  3. I am also really good at qualitative data analysis, focus groups (planning, executing, data collection/analysis and reporting).
  4. I have a research background, both collegiate and professional, and have been involved in M&E projects in some capacity since 2010.
    
- 📫 How to reach me: Email is your best bet! I'm available at roseline.twagiramariya@gmail.com and you can check out my Linkedin [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roselinetwagiramariya/).

- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her!
  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love hiking with my 2 dogs - Leo (a belgian malinois) and Jack Jack (a hound mix/mystery)!
  Both are rescues from Rwanda that liked me enough to let me move them back to the U.S. with me!
